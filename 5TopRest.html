                <p>Gen Korean BBQ is one of the <i>best</i> places in Tempe for authentic Korean BBQ. You can cook it in front of you and your friends.
                    It's a great time and a great atmosphere for groups or couples.

                <p>The Thirsty Lion Gastropub has the best music playing as you're eating. They even play cool music videos. Their drinks are innovative and it's a good time
                    for those who want a relaxing place to eat <i>and</i> a good bar.

                <a href="https://www.olivegarden.com/home" target="_blank">Olive Garden</a>
                <p>Olive Garden has been an American staple for a long time. This has been one of my favorite restaurants since I was a child. Perhaps it's the nostalgia of it,
                    however I still really like their food. It's basic, but it's good comfort food.

                <a href="https://www.redlobster.com/" target="_blank">Red Lobster</a>
                <p>Red Lobster took me some time to get into, since I don't have an affinity for seafood. As I got older I started to appreciate it more. Their crab and lobster combo
                    is some of the best, even better than really expensive restaurants.

                <a href="https://tempemarketplace.com/tenant/kabuki-japanese-restaurant/" target="_blank">Kabuki</a>
                <p>Kabuki is a simple <i>but</i> stylish japanese restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. It offers many staple Japanese foods for anyone to eat. The dessert is
                also the best part of the entire place. The vibe of the restaurant is good as well, having many homages to Japan.</p>
